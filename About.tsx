      <p>
        LeadBridge is a global leadership platform built for student councils and leadership groups to collaborate,
        share, and grow. We believe in empowering students to connect beyond borders and learn from each otherâ€™s
        creativity and leadership styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform was created as a school project but is evolving into a real-world tool that supports student-led
        change, event planning, and leadership development across the globe.
